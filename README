TOASTER is the "TOAs Tracker". It is designed to store reduced/folded
observations, meta data, templates, parfiles, TOAs, timfiles in an organized
manner using an SQL database. The framework can also be used to generate TOAs
from observations using flexible and repoducible plugins referred to as
"manipulators".
